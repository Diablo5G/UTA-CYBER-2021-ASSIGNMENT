# Certification Prep

---

While Security+, CEH, and CISSP are some of the most popular certifications, there are many other information security certifications and courses that are available for free or have minimal fees. I personally want to be SOC Analyst or any related in this field so I aimed to pursue Splunk certifications, at least I hope it will land me to the jobs I expected to do.

For this week's homework, I will share a guide list of resources on how to pass basic Splunk certification. I'd been able to complete one of these SIEM certifications from Splunk the last two months ago.
