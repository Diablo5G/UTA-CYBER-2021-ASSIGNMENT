# Certification Prep

---

While Security+, CEH, and CISSP are some of the most popular certifications, there are many other information security certifications and courses that are available for free or have minimal fees. I personally want to be *SOC Analyst* or any related in this field so I aimed to pursue Splunk certifications, at least I hope it will land me to the jobs I expected to do.

Splunk skills is a desireable qualification for many infosec positions. For example:

 - **SOC analysts** work in a Security Operations department alongside security engineers. Their positions involve detecting, containing, and potentially remediating information security threats. Most SOC analysts use SIEM products, such as Splunk ES, to monitor their environment.

 - **Cyber threat analysts** analyze an organization's networks and applications to protect organizations from cybercriminals. Cyber threat analysts often use Splunk products to make predictions about cybercriminals and what attacks they may conduct.

 - **Application security engineers** can use Splunk to fix web and mobile application vulnerabilities. AppSec engineers use Splunk to analyze their application logs to assist with creating and testing their remediation.

 - **Network security administrators** use products like Splunk to monitor suspicious network traffic, such as DDOS attacks. They can use the findings from Splunk logs to mitigate and prevent against future attacks.

 - **Incident response managers** can use Splunk to monitor the status of ongoing security investigations when an incident has occurred.

For this week's homework, I will share a guide list of resources on how to pass basic Splunk certification. I'd been able to complete one of these SIEM certifications from Splunk the last two months ago.
