# Week 22 : Certification Prep

While Security+, CEH, and CISSP are some of the most popular certifications, there are many other information security certifications and courses that are available for free or have minimal fees. I personally want to be SOC Analyst or any related in this fields so I aimed to pursue Splunk certifications, at least I hope it will land me to the jobs I expected to do. 

- For this week's homework, I'd been able to completed one of these SIEM certifications from Splunk.
