## Windows Server Logs
#### Report Analysis for Severity

Did you detect any suspicious changes in severity?

- **ANS:** Yes. The percentages changed from:

   ```
   High: 6.91%
   Informational: 93.09%
   ```

![Report_W_2](https://github.com/Diablo5G/UTA-CYBER-2021-ASSIGNMENT/blob/Master/Defensive%20Security%20Unit/19-Protecting%20VSI%20from%20Future%20Attacks/Images/Report_W_2.png)

to:
	
   ```
   High: 20.22%
   Informational: 79.78%
   ```

![Report_WA_1](/Images/Part_1-Activity/P1_Report_top_severity_windows_server_attack_logs.PNG)

- This indicates an increase in the high severity cases.


#### Report Analysis for Failed Activities

Did you detect any suspicious changes in failed activities?

- **ANS:** Yes. The percentages changed from:

   ```
   success: 97.02%
   failure: 2.98%
   ```

![Report_W_3](https://github.com/Diablo5G/UTA-CYBER-2021-ASSIGNMENT/blob/Master/Defensive%20Security%20Unit/19-Protecting%20VSI%20from%20Future%20Attacks/Images/Report_W_3.png)

to:

   ```
   success: 98.44%
   failure: 1.56%
   ```

![Report_WA_2](https://github.com/Diablo5G/UTA-CYBER-2021-ASSIGNMENT/blob/Master/Defensive%20Security%20Unit/19-Protecting%20VSI%20from%20Future%20Attacks/Images/Report_W_3.png)

- This indicates that there is not a major change in the cumulative failure of events.

#### Alert Analysis for Failed Windows Activity

Did you detect a suspicious volume of failed activity?

If so, what was the count of events in the hour(s) it occurred? When did it occur?

![Alert_Failed_Windows_Activity](/Images/Part_1-Activity/P1_Alert_for_Failed_Windows_Activity.PNG)

- **ANS:** There is some potential suspicious activity for failed activity between 8 a.m. and 9 a.m. on Weds, March 25th.

![Suspicious_Failed_Activity](/Images/Attack_Logs/P2-3_Suspicious_failed_Windows_activity.PNG)

- **ANS:** The count of activity is 35 events during this hour, "A privileged service was called, where the user account was deleted, Domain Policies were changed, A user account was created, An attempt was made to reset an accounts password, and A computer account was deleted."

Would your alert be triggered for this activity?

- **ANS:** Yes, it would have alerted the SOC Analyst of the suspicious logons. 


After reviewing, would you change your threshold from what you you previously selected?

- **ANS:** No, it is set appropriately for the hourly settings, it would have also triggered an alert for the activity for the second hour from 12 p.m. to 1 p.m. on the same day.

                
   
#### Alert Analysis for Successful Logons

Did you detect a suspicious volume of successful logons?

![Windows_Server_Monitoring_DashBoard_attacks_on_the_server-2](/Images/Part_2-Activity/P2_Windows_Server_Monitoring_DashBoard_attacks_on_the_server-2.PNG)

- What time did it start and stop for each signature? What is the peak count of the different signatures?

  **ANS:** 
  - `A user account was locked out:` Started around `1 a.m. and ended at 3 a.m. on March 25th.` The peak count was `896`, and the total for the two hours was `(805 + 896 = 1701).`
  - `An attempt was made to reset a users password:` Started around `9 a.m. and ended at 11 a.m. on March 25th.` The peak count was `1,258`, and the total for the two hours was `(1258 + 761 = 2019)`.  
  - `The account was successfully logged on:` Started around `11 a.m. and ended at 1 p.m. on March 25th.` The peak count was `196`, and the total for the two hours was `(196 + 77 = 273)`.

 #### Dashboard Analysis for Users

- Does anything stand out as suspicious? Which users stand out?

  - **ANS:** Yes, the users that have suspicious activity are users `A`, `K`, and `J`.

- What time did it begin and stop for each user? What is the peak count of the different user?

  **ANS:** 
  - `User A:` Started around `1 a.m. and ended at 3 a.m. on March 25th.` Peak count was `984`, and the total for the two hours was `(799 + 984 = 1783)`.
  - `User K:` Started around `9 a.m. and ended at 11 AM on March 25th.` Peak count was `1,256`, and the total for the two hours was `(1256 + 761 = 2017)`.  
  - `User J:` Started around `11 a.m. and ended at 1 p.m. on March 25th.` Peak count was `196`, and the total for the two hours was `(196 + 82 = 278)`.

#### Dashboard Analysis for Signatures with Bar, Graph, Pie Charts

- Does anything stand out as suspicious?

  - **ANS:** No.

- Do the results match your findings in your time chart for signatures?
  
  - **ANS:** All Charts are showing the same information as above for the Signatures.
			
#### Dashboard Analysis for Users with Bar, Graph, Pie Charts

- Does anything stand out as suspicious?
  
  - **ANS:** No

- Do the results match your findings in your time chart for users?

  - **ANS:** All Charts are showing the same information as above for the Users.

#### Dashboard Analysis for Users with Statistical Chart   

- What would be the advantage/disadvantage of using this report, compared to the other user panels you created?

  - **ANS:** There is only one advantage of the stats chart, as it will only give the total count of the users activity or the percentage of the activity. However, the disadvantage of the stats chart compared to a chart will show a cumulative perspective, while a time chart shows the suspicious activity over a more specific, and shorter time frame.

    - Yes, as the threshold was set at `200`, so this activity would be triggered as part of the alert.  
    - No, as itâ€™s above the activity set threshold.

![Alert_baseline_and_threshold_for_hourly_count_of_activity_from_a_country_other_than_the_United_States](/Images/Part_2-Activity/P2_Alert_baseline_and_threshold_for_hourly_count_of_activity_from_a_country_other_than_the_United_States.PNG)
