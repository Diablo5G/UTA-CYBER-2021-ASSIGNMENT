### Activity File: Part 1 - Master of the SOC

- Each group is playing the role of an SOC analyst at a small company called Virtual Space Industries (VSI), which designs virtual reality programs for businesses.

- VSI has heard rumors that a competitor, JobeCorp, may be launching cyberattacks to disrupt VSI's business.

- As SOC analysts, we are tasked with using Splunk to monitor against potential attacks on your systems and applications.

- Our Networking team has provided you with past logs to help you develop baselines and create reports, alerts, and dashboards.

### Activity File: Part 2 - Defend Your SOC

- VSI recently experienced several cyberattacks, likely from their adversary JobeCorp.

- Fortunately, our SOC team had set up several monitoring solutions to help VSI quickly identify what was attacked.

- These monitoring solutions will also help VSI create mitigation strategies to protect the organization.

### Activity File: Part 3 - Protecting VSI from Future Attacks

- We set up our SOC and monitored attacks from JobeCorp. Now, we will need to design mitigation strategies to protect VSI from future attacks.
