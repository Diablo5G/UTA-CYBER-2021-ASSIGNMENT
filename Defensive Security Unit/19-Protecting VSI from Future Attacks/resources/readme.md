## Solution Unit 19 Homework: Protecting VSI from Future Attacks

### Scenario

We set up our SOC and monitored attacks from JobeCorp. Now, we will need to design mitigation strategies to protect VSI from future attacks. 

We are tasked with using our findings from the Master of SOC activity to answer questions about mitigation strategies.

### System Requirements 

You will be using the Splunk app located in the Ubuntu VM.

### Logs

Use the same log files you used during the Master of SOC activity:

- [Windows Logs](resources/windows_server_logs.csv)
- [Windows Attack Logs](resources/windows_server_attack_logs.csv)
- [Apache Webserver Logs](resources/apache_logs.txt	)
