2. Operating System: 
• What Linux is? What is a distribution? 
ANS = Linux is a free, open-source software operating system (OS) built on the Linux kernel. It was created by Linus Torvalds after he became curious about operating systems while attending the University of Helsinki in 1991. When he ran into licensing issues, he began work on his own OS kernel, which ended up as the Linux kernel. He made the source code freely available under the GNU General Public License. This spawned a rich diversity of Linux distributions built around the same Linux kernel.

• Why there are so many distributions and what open source means?
ANS = Because it is open-source software, anyone can make their own Linux distribution by assembling it from the source code themselves, or by modifying an existing distribution. The Open Source Definition is used by the Open Source Initiative (OSI) to determine whether a software license qualifies for the organization's insignia for open-source software. Open-source software (OSS) is computer software that is released under a license in which the copyright holder grants users the rights to use, study, change, and distribute the software and its source code to anyone and for any purpose.

Part 2
• What cybersecurity means to you? what you are most interested in, and what you hope to get out of this boot camp experience?
ANS = I want to retrieve my career in IT field back so I started research Cybersecurity and also my family supported me to educate in this popular IT career and found out IT boot camp is the best fit for me. Therefore, I contacted many availabilities Cybersecurity boot camps program based on ranking website and found 2 boot camps in my local area which are UT Austin and Divergence Academy, I determined with PROS and CONS between these boot camp and finally enrolled to UT Austin base on reviews and reputation. I plan to pursue GIAC GCIH certification or/and Certified Ethical Hacker (CEH), AZ-104 Microsoft Azure Administrator after graduate the Cybersecurity boot camp which I believe it's right for me (Blue Team). Currently, I hold several CompTia and Microsoft certifications as well as a Bachelor of Science in Information Technology and a Master of Science in Information Technology Management.  

• What do you want to learn from this boot camp? 
ANS =  I want to learn to stay ethical, get hands-on skills for penetration testing, training in networking, systems, web technologies, and defensive and offensive Cybersecurity.

• Are there any topics or domains that you are most excited about? 
ANS = I explored the curriculum in cybersecurity program, each section is interesting, excited and terrified me somehow. To be honest, while some of them I did experiences before except ethical hacking and penetration part, I don't have skills in hacking or python programming, totally new for me.


• How will the skills you'll learn in this class help your career? 
ANS = Currently seeking a remote position in the related field and had a few applied jobs in the market since March 2021, but unfortunately its unsuccessful yet, the whole package of my job profile is not outstanding because of the big gaps of 5 years that I missed to obtain IT experiences, [hence, these 5 yrs is not a mistake :) ] I do believe career services center will provide valuable lessons, resources, and insights used to guide me for job search.
